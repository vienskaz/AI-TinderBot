 based on the photos shared on the platform. Currently model is trained to swipe right on blonde people.

 To run this bot you have to own a Tinder account connected to gmail,
 chromedriver in project folder
 In login.py file you need to adjust your's login and password to your's gmail
 account to log in properly.

 Running bot is done by main.py.
